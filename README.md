**Find the Missing Element** - finder.php.
Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

Input: finder( \[5, 5, 7, 7\], \[7, 5, 5\]);

Output: 7
